# Square Escape

## Description

##Square Escape is a simple 2D game where you control a flying character up and down, while trying to avoid obstacles in order to achieve a high score.
The game is similar to Flappy Bird but instead of physics to keep the player afloat, the game requires simple up and down (or the option of W and D) key presses for movement.
