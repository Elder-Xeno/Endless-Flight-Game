# Square Escape

## Description

## Square Escape is a simple 2D game where you control a character using up and down movement, while trying to avoid obstacles in order to achieve a high score.
The game is similar to Flappy Bird, but instead of physics to keep the player afloat, the game only requires the use of simple up and down (or the option of W and D) key presses.
Square Escape was made as an easy to pick up and play game, for people of all ages.

## Next Steps

I would like to change the obstacles, player and theme, maybe rewrite the game using something other than canvas.
I also plan to add animation for collision, maybe some sound effects and music.
