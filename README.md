# Endless-Flight-Game

## Description

<Your game's title>: Endless Flight Game is a simple 2D game where you control a flying character up and down, while trying to avoid obstacles in order to achieve a high score.
The game is similar to Flappy Bird but instead of physics to keep the player afloat, the game requires the use of either "W" & "D", or "upArrow" & "downArrow" keys, in order to move the player up and down.
